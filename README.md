# Employee Management System
Full Stack Practice. We used Spring Boot framework to handle our backend CRUD operations. 
Our operations consisted of getting a creating an employee, getting an employee, 
getting a list of the employees, updating an employee, and deleting an employee. 
We connected our backend to a MySQL database to store our data.
We built a 3-layer architecture. A Controller layer, Service layer, and a DAO layer. 
The DAO layer is responsible for talking to the database. The Service layer contains the 
logic of the application. The Controller layer contains the spring controllers which handle the 
REST APIs.
